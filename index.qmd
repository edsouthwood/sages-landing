This is a open repo of notes about the world - some common knowledge. Please feel free to read as much or as little as you like.

The Devonian alps divide the known realms in two (well three if you include the gateway to the Underdark). Sitting at the centre of this natural wall, at the only sea crossing for many leagues, is Sage’s Landing. An independent city state and bastion of learning, trade and most importantly opportunity. They say that: ‘the landing’ has wealth for the taking. Anyone with the brawn, brains, or bravery can have it since the cobbles are made of gold (perhaps it’s just a reflection of the setting sun after the regular rainstorms). This is while people from all over the world flock to the city.
 
Sage’s Landing is a Mertiomonachy, where who sits on the throne is not decided by birthright and blood but by the rigours of meticulous examination. The person who scores highest in their SAT (Sovereign Acumen Test) will bear the mantle of leadership. The first SAT for 13 years is right around the corner. Will the encumbered king Ardent Kinnerman (kindly but said by some to be now doddery) be able to ace the test once more. Maybe, Hope, Ardent’s 13-year-old prodigy daughter may continue the family line. But the favourite is Mallodious Flint, security advisor to the king and architect of the ‘magic user and men-at-arm certification act’ more commonly known by adventurers as the irksome parchment for passage. Or perhaps you will sit the exam and become the next monarch. 
 
Be warned, becoming monarch may not be all it seems. Sage's Landing, strategically positioned between realms, attracts envy from powerful entities across all directions. 
 
So where will you headfirst? To Scholar’s Summit where the Inspectorate are writing the next SAT. The Limpets, the makes-shift shanty town that grows up the sides of the city’s walls - its layout changes with each large storm but you can be sure to find anything you want so long as you're not fussy about the paperwork that goes with it. Mothers Maw, the huge tidal cavern that serves as a refuge for ships in a storm and is home to the now sealed gateway to the Underdark. Or maybe you’ll just head to the pub.
