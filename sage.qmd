# Sage's Landing

![](./img/sage's%20landing4.jpeg)

The Devonian alps divide the known realms in two (well three if you include the gateway to the Underdark). Sitting at the centre of this natural wall, at the only sea crossing for many leagues, is Sage’s Landing. An independent city state and bastion of learning, trade and most importantly opportunity. They say that: ‘the landing’ has wealth for the taking. Anyone with the brawn, brains, or bravery can have it since the cobbles are made of gold (perhaps it’s just a reflection of the setting sun after the regular rainstorms). This is while people from all over the world flock to the city.
 
Sage’s Landing is a Mertiomonachy, where who sits on the throne is not decided by birthright and blood but by the rigours of meticulous examination. The person who scores highest in their SAT (Sovereign Acumen Test) will bear the mantle of leadership. The first SAT for 13 years is right around the corner. Will the encumbered king Ardent Kinnerman (kindly but said by some to be now doddery) be able to ace the test once more. Maybe, Hope, Ardent’s 13-year-old prodigy daughter may continue the family line. But the favourite is Mallodious Flint, security advisor to the king and architect of the ‘magic user and men-at-arm certification act’ more commonly known by adventurers as the irksome parchment for passage. Or perhaps you will sit the exam and become the next monarch. 
 
Be warned, becoming monarch may not be all it seems. Sage's Landing, strategically positioned between realms, attracts envy from powerful entities across all directions. 
 
So where will you headfirst? To Scholar’s Summit where the Inspectorate are writing the next SAT. The Limpets, the makes-shift shanty town that grows up the sides of the city’s walls - its layout changes with each large storm but you can be sure to find anything you want so long as you're not fussy about the paperwork that goes with it. Mothers Maw, the huge tidal cavern that serves as a refuge for ships in a storm and is home to the now sealed gateway to the Underdark. Or maybe you’ll just head to the pub. 

Notable areas:

- Scholar’s Summit: Already mentioned in your introduction, this is the intellectual heart of Sage’s Landing. It could house the Great Library of Arcanum, a vast repository of knowledge guarded by sentient constructs. It could also include various colleges and institutes where scholars and magicians study and teach.
- The Limpets: The dynamic, makeshift shanty town clinging to the city's walls. This area could feature The Market of Whispers, an underground bazaar where rare and illegal goods are traded. It could also have The Rusty Nail, a notorious tavern known for its rowdy patrons and secret backroom dealings.
- Mother’s Maw: The tidal cavern refuge for ships. This could be expanded to include The Underdark Dockyards, a hidden port where smugglers and privateers operate. Additionally, it could contain The Sealed Gate, a mysterious, ancient portal to the Underdark, guarded by a secretive order of warriors.
- The Golden Plaza: The central marketplace of Sage’s Landing, famed for its opulent merchant stalls and grand festivals. Here, you might find The Fountain of Fortunes, a magical fountain said to bring luck to those who toss a coin in.

- The Artisan’s Quarter: A district dedicated to craftsmen and artists. Here, you might find The Gilded Anvil, a renowned blacksmith shop, and The Silken Thread, a tailor's shop famous for its exquisite garments and enchanted fabrics.
- The Temple of Unity: A grand temple dedicated to multiple deities worshiped throughout the realms. This could include The Hall of Echoes, a sacred chamber where prayers and rituals are conducted, and The Celestial Spire, a towering structure that offers a breathtaking view of the city and surrounding lands.
- The Understreets: A network of tunnels and catacombs beneath the city. This area could feature The Thieves' Den, a hidden refuge for the city’s criminal underworld, and The Shadow Market, a clandestine marketplace for stolen goods and forbidden artifacts.
